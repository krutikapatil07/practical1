<title>Cloud Computing</title>
<p> Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources—like servers, storage, software, and analytics—over the internet, often with pay-as-you-go pricing, allowing users to access and use them without owning physical hardware. This model provides flexibility, scalability, reliability, and cost savings, as users only pay for the services they consume from cloud providers who manage the underlying infrastructure in remote data centers.</p>
